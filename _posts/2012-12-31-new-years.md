Hello World! 

I've been wanting to create a blog, mainly to talk about new technologies I encounter on a daily basis, mainly as a way to remind myself they exist and to go back and use them again in the future. 

I have made it my goal to update this blog at least once a week.

My first language is Spanish, and I love being latino. I don't want to ever forget this nor my language, so there will be posts in spanish throughout this journey.
