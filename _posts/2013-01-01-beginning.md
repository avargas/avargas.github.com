2013 is here!

I've spent almost 10 years learning and working on the Internet (sometime around 2003 was when I got my first real computer with Internet!). It's been an amazing ride, and I've some amazing people around the world. I've learned so many new skills that have landed me jobs through freelancing, and a 5 year long employment at an Internet Marketing company in Oklahoma City, OK.

It's been an amazing ride, but this journey seriously needs a new chapter, that involves many changes. From personal changes to career changes.

I don't believe in New Year Resolutions, but I've sort of made a list of things I'd like to complete by the end of 2014.

# Personal Goals

## Stop procrastination
This has been my biggest pitfalls. I procrastinate too much (damn you reddit!). One of my biggest goals is to stop browsing reddit so much, maybe keeping it at a limit of 30 minutes per day. I don't even want to calculate how long I spend on reddit.

## Lose some weight
I've gained a few pounds over the last 10 years, and in the 2 years, I lost a few pounds - about half of my initial goal. I've waited too long and kept it off but need to finish what I started, and will be completing the remaining pounds, hopefully within the first 3 to 6 months.

## Gain some strength
I've read a lot about health issues in our line of work, from back problems to back shoulders with very little strenght, and lot's of issues regarding [your posture](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4988649). I plan on starting a workout routine, mainly to regain, did I even have any in the first place?, my strength.

## Socialize more
This is an issue I've waited too long for. I socialize a _little_ bit, but not a whole lot. I want to go to a few reddit meetups, start doing more things outside the tech world like learning a new skill that requires socialization (scuba diving?).

## US Citizenship
After many years in this country, I'm finally able to apply for the US Citizenship.

## Move 2,000 miles away
I was born in Venezuela, and have waited many years to make my dream come true and to move back to my home country. My dad and most of my family still lives there, and I want to _temporarily_ move there for a few months.

# Career Goals
## Focus on freelancing
I quit my fulltime job around October, 2012 and started working as a freelance software developer. Having a few contacts from the years of doing slight contract work, I managed to get enough work to fill my plate for the last two months. The transition was painfully hard, mainly because working from home is quite a shocker, but I managed to deliver a few things I had to work on, and still have work.  My main goal is to keep clients happier, network more, and find more work. 

## Network more
Since my job now is about freelancing, one of my goals for 2013 is to go to more meetings and to network with more people, grow my [Linkdin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/angelovargas) connections, and find more clients through the process.

## Build some of my ideas
I've talked through the years about some small ideas I've had, but it seems that most of the time it has been about more talking and less doing. I need to build some of them, and change my views on things. Try ideas, build those crazy things I keep thinking about. They might fail, but at least I tried to chase an idea until it crashed than see it disappear.

## Start working on my own startup
This seems to be my biggest goal for 2013. Trying to start something that could lead to my a successful future. More to come on this.

## Learn new technologies & languages
I love learning new things, and love learning new things. I want to focus on Python this year, and grow my knowledge for it more. I can write python without Google for a while but I don't know much about many libraries nor projects out there.


There's probably more things I should be focusing on, but if I can't remember them, they must not be too important, right?
