<h1>About</h1>

My name is Angelo Vargas and I'm a software developer!.

My plan for 2013 was to start a blog and write technical things that come to my head, and hopefully try to write some in my native language, Spanish. 

About me, I've been developing software for the last 10 years. I moved to the United States in 2002 from Venezuela and ever since my mom bought me my first computer, I started messing with websites and eventually started coding complex non-trivial applications. 

I worked at an internet marketing company since my beginning my last year in High School and left that company in October, 2012 and decided to work as a Software Consultant.
